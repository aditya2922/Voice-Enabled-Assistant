# Voice-Enabled Assistant

Welcome to the Voice-Enabled Assistant project â€“ an intelligent, voice-activated virtual assistant designed to enhance user interactions through advanced speech recognition and natural language understanding. This project integrates OpenAI's Whisper for accurate voice processing, GPT-3.5-turbo for conversational intelligence, Microsoft Bing AI for additional context, and Amazon Polly for lifelike voice synthesis.

## Key Features

- **Wake-Up Command Recognition:** Initiate conversations effortlessly with a personalized wake-up command, creating a seamless and engaging user experience.

- **Voice Input Processing:** Leverage OpenAI Whisper to transcribe voice input into text, enabling clear and accurate communication with the assistant.

- **Response Generation:** Utilize the power of GPT-3.5-turbo or Microsoft Bing AI to generate context-aware, informative responses tailored to user queries.

- **Voice Output Generation:** Transform text responses into expressive voice output using Amazon Polly, delivering a natural and human-like interaction.
